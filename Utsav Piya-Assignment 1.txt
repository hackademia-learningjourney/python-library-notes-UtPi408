Python Libraries

1. Pandas
-Authorized under Berkeley Programing Conveyance
-Library used for data science 
-Provided high level data structures and analysis tools for ease of data analysis, data manipulation
-helpful in sorting, data conversion, visualization, aggregations, cleaning


2. NumPy
-Stands for "Numerical Python"
-Supports multi dimensional arrays and matrices used for numerical computing in python 
-consists of built in mathematical functions
-Used over python lists (which store multiple items in a single variable) as it is faster and uses less memory


3. TensorFlow
-developed by google + brain team 
-used for machine learning and deep learning algorithms
-can build deep neural networks and machine learning modules with efficient use of GPU/TPU
-used for complex physics and mathematical calculations 

4. Keras
-API for high level neural networks
-can run with TensorFlow, Theano, CNTK 
-Can facilitate fast experimentation/ prototyping of deep neural networks


5. Sklearn
-scikit-learn
-Python based open source machine learing library
-supervised and unsupervised learning methods
-can be used for data mining and data analysis
-example spotify music for "music you might like"


6. Pytorch
-developed by facebook
-used for deep learning and neural network
-has extensive library for building complex modules
-strong support for GPU acceleration
